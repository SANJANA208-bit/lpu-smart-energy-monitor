## 🎯 EASIEST WAY: Deploy using StackBlitz + Vercel

Since Node.js and Git aren't installed, here's the **absolute easiest** way:

### Step 1: Upload to StackBlitz (Online Code Editor)

1. Go to: **https://stackblitz.com/fork/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react**

2. Delete everything in the `src` folder

3. **Upload your files** from `c:\Users\SANJANA\Desktop\Project`:
   - Drag all files from your `src` folder into StackBlitz's `src` folder
   - Upload `index.html` to the root
   - Upload `package.json` to the root
   - Upload `vite.config.js` to the root

4. In StackBlitz, click the **Share** button → **Deploy to Vercel**

5. Sign up/login to Vercel

6. Deploy! You'll get a live URL in 2 minutes! 🎉

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Use Replit (Even Easier!)

1. Go to: **https://replit.com**

2. Click "Create Repl"

3. Choose "Vite (React)"

4. **Drag and drop** all your files into Replit

5. Click "Run" → Replit will build and deploy automatically

6. Share the live URL!

## 🎯 BEST OPTION: Install Node.js (One-time, 5 minutes)

This gives you the most control:

### Download Node.js:
📥 **https://nodejs.org/en/download/**
- Download the Windows Installer (.msi)
- Choose the "LTS" version (recommended)
- Install with default settings
- **Restart your computer** after installation

### Then Run These Commands:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\SANJANA\Desktop\Project
npm install
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder. Then:

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Sign up (free)
3. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
4. **Drag the `dist` folder** onto the upload area
5. Click Deploy
6. Done! 🎉

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Use StackBlitz** if you want to deploy in the next 5 minutes without installing anything!

OR

**Install Node.js** if you want a professional deployment that you can update easily later.
